Spotify Developer Credentials
You will need a Spotify Developer Account and a registered app. Follow these steps to obtain your credentials:

Create a Spotify Developer Account:

Visit the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
Log in using your Spotify account or create a new one.
Create an Application:

Once logged in, go to the "Dashboard" and click on the Create an App button.
Fill out the required details (name, description, etc.) for your app.
Retrieve Client Credentials:

After creating the app, youâ€™ll be able to view the Client ID and Client Secret.
Keep these credentials secure as they are required for authentication.
Set Redirect URI:

In the app settings on the Spotify Developer Dashboard, add a redirect URI: http://localhost:8888/callback.
This URI will be used during the OAuth authentication process to redirect you back to the application.

Clone or download this repository.
Open the script and replace the client_id and client_secret in the SpotifyStatsGenerator class with your Spotify app credentials.
Run the script using:
